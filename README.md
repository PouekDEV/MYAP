A Minimalistic Youtube Audio Player (MYAP)

# Installation
MYAP for now only supports Windows

- Download ffmpeg and ffprobe from here https://www.ffmpeg.org/
- Download MYAP latest release from here https://github.com/PouekDEV/MYAP/releases
- Extract MYAP into a folder

# Back story
I created this app just because one song that I really like is only available on YouTube and imo web browsers are too heavy for just playing audio from YouTube and I didn't need video. And this is how MYAP was created.
