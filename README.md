(If you don't like having your music displayed on Discord as your status change line "enable_rich_presence" in config.toml to "false")
```TOML
enable_rich_presence = false
```


# Back story
I created this app just because one song that I really like is only available on YouTube and imo web browsers are too heavy for just playing audio from YouTube and I didn't need video.
